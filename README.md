# Happy Hour
Upon exploring [Application Programming Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), I had come across a [Cocktail API](https://api-cocktails.herokuapp.com/api/v1/cocktails) which provided the user with various information depending on the level of access key obtained. From this, Happy Hour was created on the basis of easily providing individuals access to 20 different cocktail descriptions and images. 

I had decided to target cocktails specifically as to not want to overload the user with information and keep it niche. Cocktails generally consist of fun and fruity mixtures and are usually associated with happy hours, hence the name of the website. The alcohol business is a forever growing industry, and due to current circumstances involving lockdown of pubs, bars and restaurants a lot of individuals have concluded to consuming alcohol from the comfort of their own homes. Taking all this into consideration, I felt it would be a good opportunity to develop a website which provided users with information about specific alcoholic drinks for them to be able to make and enjoy at home.
